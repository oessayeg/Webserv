# Webserv

Welcome to Webserv, a C++98 based web server that is designed for small sized projects to serve static and dynamic web content.
It is easy to configure and use.

## Setup
  * Clang should be installed. (Obviously to compile C++ code)
  * Make is optional. (if you want to use the Makefile)
  * This project was developed under a unix environment (macOS). Compiling this code without errors in any other environment is not guaranteed.
